                    <p>The best aspects is that living on campus is extremely easy to go to lectures and all scheduled events, it is easy to go round and there are many things you can do such as walk around the farm etc, as well as this there is also access to the bus to get to and back from Newport.
                         The  aspect is that there is  that much to do when things are taking place such as there are  many communal areas for students to meet and chat, as well as this in catered accommodations there is  access to an oven or hob which is kind of pleasing when we have to make our own foods on weekends. 
                         Apart from that this university is great and I am loving it.</p>

                    <p>I love thé location of this hall as it is extremely close to all of my courses and so is extremely useful if I have to go back and collect something that I have forgotten.
                         In terms of value for money I do not think it is great. 
                         It is quite expensive as we are catered for Monday - Friday.
                          However we have to provide our own meal for weekends but do not have access to a hob or oven and this is kind of annoying as you cant make much food with just a microwave and kettle so I wish there were bigger facilities.
                           As well as this there is no common area for everyone to meet and chill together and the kitchens are extremely small, meaning that there isnt really time for everyone to chill and enjoy each others company.
                            However, the rooms are great and if decorated then the room feels a lot more homey and feels a lot better.
                             This place is now getting better as the days go on.</p>
